speed, lives and score :
1-speed:





2-lives:

Each player has 3 lives, so each time the paddle misses the ball the lives
are reduced by one and the game is restarted where it was left.
If there is no lives left, the next miss will set a dead signal that will 
restart all the modules of the game. This is the score corresponding to that
section:

if lives_reg > x"0" then
  lives_reg <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(lives_reg)-1);
  restart   <= '1';
else
  dead_reg <= '1';
end if;

3-scores:

Each time the ball hit a brick, the score is incremented by one.
the score output is a std_logic_vector (11 downto 0).
Each 4 bits reprensent a number (0 through 9) (scores.dia (a)). This implementation was chosen
for a matter of simplicity for the BreakRaster.
If one of the three numbers (11 downto 8), (7 downto 4) or (3 downto 0) equals
9, it is just cleared and the next number is incremented (score.dia (b)). The following code
reflect this behavior: 

if score_reg (3 downto 0) = x"9" then
  score_reg (3 downto 0) <= x"0";
  if score_reg (7 downto 4) = x"9" then
    score_reg (7 downto 4) <= x"0";
    score_reg (11 downto 8) <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(score_reg (11 downto 8)) + 1);
  else
    score_reg (7 downto 4) <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(score_reg (7 downto 4)) + 1);
  end if;
else
    score_reg (3 downto 0) <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(score_reg (3 downto 0)) + 1);
end if;
